Why avoid eval?  
Answer :: eval executes strings as code, disabling many engine optimizations and introducing security risks like injection, making safer alternatives preferable.

ESM vs CommonJS?  
Answer :: ESM has static import/export and live bindings friendly to tree-shaking, while CommonJS uses require/module.exports with dynamic loading semantics and value copies at import time.
