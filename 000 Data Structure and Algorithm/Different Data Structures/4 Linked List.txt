Each “node” in a linked list has data and a “pointer” to the next “node” in the list. Each element in the array represents a link in the chain, and the array is typically implemented as a linked list.

Advantages of linked lists
It’s dynamic. A linked list lets you add and remove items at any time without changing the rest of the structure.
You can easily traverse the list by following references.
It’sIt’s easy to implement with an array or other data structure.

Finding the end of the list or inserting new entries anywhere but the beginning or the end can take time and effort.
