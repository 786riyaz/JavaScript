Set recursive methods help solve problems that contain cycles or loops. Suppose you have a problem that requires iteration but involves a loop that goes on forever and never ends; consider using a recursive method instead. Set-based recursion is especially effective at solving problems involving sets of data and operations such as union, difference, composition, and intersection.

Advantages of  Set
Recursive methods are more efficient than iterative algorithms because they do not require additional memory space beyond that required by the input data.

Disadvantages of  Set
Set-based recursion is especially effective at solving problems involving data sets and operations such as union, difference, composition, and intersection.
