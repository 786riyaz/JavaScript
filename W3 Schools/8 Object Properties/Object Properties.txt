An Object is an Unordered Collection of Properties
Properties are the most important part of JavaScript objects.
Properties can be changed, added, deleted, and some are read only.

Adding New Properties
You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value:
Example
person.nationality = "English";
person[nationality] = "English";

Deleting Properties
The delete keyword deletes a property from an object:
delete person.age;
delete person["age"];

The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.
After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.

Nested Objects
Property values in an object can be other objects:
Example
myObj = {
  name:"John",
  age:30,
  myCars: {
    car1:"Ford",
    car2:"BMW",
    car3:"Fiat"
  }
}
myObj.myCars.car2;
myObj.myCars["car2"];
myObj["myCars"]["car2"];
