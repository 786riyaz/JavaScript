Object methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
A method is a function definition stored as a property value.

firstName	John
lastName	Doe
age	50
eyeColor	blue
fullName	function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}

const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

Accessing Object Methods
You access an object method with the following syntax:
objectName.methodName()
If you invoke the fullName property with (), it will execute as a function:
Example
name = person.fullName();

Adding a Method to an Object
Adding a new method to an object is easy:
Example
person.name = function () {
  return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};
