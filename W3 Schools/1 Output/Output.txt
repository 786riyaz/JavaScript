Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

Never call document.write after the document has finished loading. It will overwrite the whole document.

The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.
