JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
String
Number
Bigint

Object

The Object Datatype
The object data type can contain both built-in objects, and user defined objects:

Built-in object types can be:

objects, arrays, dates, maps, sets, intarrays, floatarrays, promises, and more.

JavaScript BigInt
All JavaScript numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format.

JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.
