One type of data structure is the queue, which maintains data by arranging objects in a predefined sequence. One analogy is a line at the supermarket, with customers entering at one end and leaving at the other. An item is added to the queue when it enters (or becomes available) and removed from the queue when there are no longer any items ahead of it.

Advantages of the queue
A queue is a linear data structure, meaning it can only be accessed in one direction. This makes queues ideal for storing items that need to be processed in the order in which they arrive.
The number of people waiting in line at the supermarket is an example of a queue whose size is fixed but which may alter over time as things are added or deleted.
When items are added to a queue, they are also processed in the order in which they are added to it. This data structure is called a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.

Disadvantages of queue
A queue has a fixed size, so if your application needs to handle items of different sizes or types, you may need multiple queues.
The order in which data is processed can’t be changed once it’s been added to the queue.
Queues are often used with other data structures, like stacks and lists.
