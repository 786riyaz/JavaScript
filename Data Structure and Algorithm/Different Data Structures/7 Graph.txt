A graph is a mathematical structure that consists of nodes (also called vertices) and edges connecting those nodes. Nodes are the vertices of a graph. Edges can connect nodes. The nodes in a graph are also called vertices. Edges are the lines connecting the nodes of a graph.

Advantages of using graphs
They make it easy to understand how data flows through an application by showing relationships between different entities connected.
Graphs can be used to represent relationships that exist between two or more entities. This means that they can be used to represent things like customer relationships and product features.

Disadvantages of Graphs
Graphs are difficult to understand and calculate
Graphs are complicated
Graphs have no clear boundaries
Graphs are not easy to define
