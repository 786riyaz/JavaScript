---------------------------------Heaps
Heaps are similar to arrays, but they have different data storage methods. For example, an array stores its elements as a sequence of values, whereas heaps store their elements as a simple key-value pair.

Advantages of heaps
Heaps can store large amounts of data and process it quickly.
Heaps allow you to use large objects without worrying about memory allocation or garbage collection.

Disadvantages of heaps
You must keep track of all the objects in a heap, which can be difficult if you have many.
Heaps are more flexible than objects because they cannot be passed around between functions.
